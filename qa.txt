Description of bugs that came up:
1. Bug: Game crashed on "play again"
    - Noticed: The application threw a "set state after disposed from widget tree" exception.
    - Fixed: Disposed of tiles while reinitializing the game state.

2. Bug: Random maps caused the game to not display the loading spinner and freeze after pressing "play again"
    - Noticed: The game would freeze without an exception being thrown after pressing "play again" and stay stuck on the last map
    - Fixed: Added an impossible http get in a try/catch to try and simulate the alternative api maps fetch, and it works? good enough for me

3. Bug: Android application in release didn't load properly
    - Noticed: After installing the apk on my phone and opening it, the loading spinner was infinitely spinning
    - Fixed: Added INTERNET permission in android main manifest (why is it added in debug by default but not in main?)


Ways you would test the projects of other contestants:
1. Functional Testing:
    - Check that the game correctly identifies the island with the highest average height.
    - Ensure that the game ends and displays the correct result when the player runs out of attempts.

2. UI Testing:
    - Verify that the UI updates correctly when the game state changes.
    - Check the layout and appearance of the UI on different screen sizes and orientations.

3. Performance Testing:
    - Test the performance of the game with different configurations.
    - Check for any memory leaks or excessive resource usage.


Improvements/features you would make if you had a magic wand (able to do anything you wish for):
1. Add multiplayer support to allow players to compete against each other.
2. Implement different difficulty levels with varying map sizes and complexities.
3. Add animations and sound effects to enhance the user experience.
4. Implement a leaderboard to track and display the top scores of players.


Think of how some factors could affect your solution (e.g. map size, number of livesâ€¦):
1. Map Size:
    - Larger map sizes do increase the loading time and memory usage, and make performance significantly worse on lower-end devices.

2. Number of Lives:
    - Increasing the number of lives could make the game easier and less challenging.

3. Device Performance:
    - Optimization techniques might be needed to ensure smooth performance on lower-end devices.
